# ml
Repository to try some ML stuff, maybe convert some of it into course exercises eventually ...

# Transformer for Image Generation
## Start with CIFAR-10 one class (Ship) and see if we can generate some images that look like ships
### Architecture
1. Decoder only
2. Input channels + positional embeddings
3. Experiment with context size (1D,2D)
4. Different Hyperparameters (Number of blocks)
5. Eventually add an encoder
